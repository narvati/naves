To install a third party plugin:    
Close Construct 2    
Copy the plugin's folder to <install path>\exporters\html5\plugins. You'll see each plugin has its own folder here, so to add a new plugin create a new folder and add the plugin's files inside it. For behaviors, copy to <install path>\exporters\html5\behaviors instead.    
Launch Construct 2 and the plugin or behavior should be available from the editor.

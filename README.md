Remember: To install a third party plugin you need to Close Construct 2 ; Copy the plugin's folder to <install path>\exporters\html5\plugins. You'll see each plugin has its own folder here, so to add a new plugin create a new folder and add the plugin's files inside it; launch Construct 2 and the plugin should be available from the editor.
